This is Goober.

If all of the above seems a bit fussy, I should add that if we want to earn our living working with computers, we have to know how to maintain our machines. We can't just treat our computers as appliances that we assume will always work when we turn them on. Sometimes they need to be babied. Sometimes they don't work right no matter what we do. I should add, however, that I regular work on 5 or 6 computers or laptops, and in three or four instances of Lubuntu in Virtual Box, and it is has been a (very long - years) while since I saw an error trying to start or Firefox or Chrome. I've seen it, but it is rare.

Very nice. It is simplest for me if you just attach the bitmaps (PNG or JPG) files directly to Canvas. It saves me the stop of downloading and unzipping a file.

This is fine for now. I actually prefer for you to attach each of the bitmaps separately to Canvas. So I would expect to see four PNG files or JPG files attached to the assignment. This becomes an issue when I need to see details about a particular screenshot. In Word, the bitmap gets compressed, and it can be hard to see details. Paste them in separately, and they are much easier to see.
